# Cricfy Plugin for Kodi

![Cricfy Plugin for Kodi](plugin.video.cricfy/icon.png)

Cricfy Plugin for Kodi is an unofficial Kodi add-on that lets you stream Cricfy content directly from your Kodi media center. The plugin aggregates streams and providers to give a convenient viewing experience from within Kodi.

## Features

- Browse and play Cricfy streams from within Kodi
- Aggregates multiple providers through Cricfy for higher availability

## Installation

1. Download the latest plugin ZIP file from [Releases](https://github.com/itsyourap/cricfy-kodi-plugin/releases) to a location accessible from the device where Kodi is installed. If you received this plugin as a ZIP package, use that file.
2. Open Kodi.
3. (Optional) Enable installation from unknown sources if required:
    - Go to Settings -> System -> Add-ons and enable "Unknown sources".
4. Install the add-on from the ZIP file:
    - From Kodi's home screen, go to Add-ons.
    - Open the Add-on browser (the open box icon in the top-left).
    - Choose "Install from zip file".
    - Navigate to and select the downloaded `plugin.video.cricfy.zip` file.
    - Wait for the "Add-on enabled" (or similar) notification.
5. Launch the plugin:
    - From the home screen go to Add-ons -> Video add-ons and open "Cricfy".

Notes:

- The exact menu labels may vary slightly between Kodi versions, but the "Install from zip file" method is common to all modern Kodi releases.

## Usage

- After installation open the add-on from Video Add-ons.
- Browse available providers, then select a provider to view their channels.

## Troubleshooting

- If the add-on fails to install, double-check that you selected the correct ZIP file and that "Unknown sources" is enabled (if applicable).
- If streams fail to play, check your internet connection and try another provider/stream in the add-on.
- For persistent issues, check Kodi's log (enable debug logging in Settings -> System -> Logging) and review the log file for errors.
